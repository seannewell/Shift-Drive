# Shift-Drive
This is a saturation vst plugin with the option to blend together different distortion algorithms and alter the phase
relationship between them.

The Shift Drive was designed to be an extremely versatile saturation effect that could be used to slightly bring out 
harmonics in a mastering setting, to add more grit to an already distorted signal, or to completely warp a signal to 
create a completely new sound. With five different clipping algorithms alone, the user can get a multitude of wave shaping
curves. However, with the addition of the phase and feedback sliders, the user can get even more sounds out of the plugin.
