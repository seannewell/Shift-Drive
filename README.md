# Shift Drive
This is a saturation .vst plugin with the option to blend together different distortion algorithms and alter the phase
relationship between them. This was my submission for the 2019 AES Student Competition: MATLAB Plugin.

## About
The Shift Drive was designed to be an extremely versatile saturation effect that could be used to slightly bring out 
harmonics in a mastering setting, to add more grit to an already distorted signal, or to completely warp a signal to 
create a completely new sound. With five different clipping algorithms alone, the user can get a multitude of wave shaping
curves. However, with the addition of the phase and feedback sliders, the user can get even more sounds out of the plugin.
